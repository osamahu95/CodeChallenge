list of topics you can start with to revise your basic skills in data structures and algorithms:
    1. Arrays and Linked Lists
    2. Stacks and Queues
    3. Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps)
    4. Hash Tables
    5. Graphs
    6. Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, etc.)
    7. Searching algorithms (Linear search, Binary search)
    8. Dynamic Programming
    9. Greedy Algorithms
    10. Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you can move on to advanced topics, such as:
    1. Advanced Tree Structures (Tries, Segment Trees, etc.)
    2. Advanced Graph Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest Paths, etc.)
    3. Advanced Dynamic Programming (Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack Problem, etc.)
    4. Advanced Sorting Algorithms (Radix Sort, Counting Sort, etc.)
    5. Advanced Searching Algorithms (KMP Algorithm, Rabin-Karp Algorithm, etc.)
    6. String algorithms (Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp)
    7. Computational Geometry algorithms
    8. NP-complete problems
